# Sliding Window Approach

 <br>
 
 -  It is used to solve problems to find out the SubArray or substring that meets Certain Criteria.

## How it works :
<br>

1. Initialize two pointers, that representing the start and end of the window, at the beginning of the array or string.
<br>

2. Move the end pointer to expand the window while the criteria for the problem are met .
<br>

3. When the criteria are no longer satisfied, move the start pointer to shrink the window maintaining the minimum or maximum size required by the problem.
<br>

4. Repeat Step 2 and 3 until you've traversed the entire array or string.
