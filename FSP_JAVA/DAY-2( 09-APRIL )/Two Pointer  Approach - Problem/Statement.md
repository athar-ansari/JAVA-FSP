#Two Pointer Approach
<br>
 It is used mainly for searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list.

 This technique is particularly useful for solving problems related to finding pairs, detecting cycles, or searching for elements with specific conditions in sorted arrays or linked lists.
<br>
##Approach:
<br>

1. Initialize two pointers, typically one at the beginning and one at the end.

2. Move the pointers towards each other or in some cases, one pointer moves faster than the other.

3. Update the pointers based on certain conditions or constraints.

4. Continue until the pointers meet or cross each other.
